# Challenge 1 - Kickstarting with Excel
Funding analysis using a kickstarter data for a campaign  organizer
## Overview of Project
Louise , a Fever play fundraising organizer would like to know about crowdfunding campaign, her  play has a $10000 budget goal  came close to its fundaraising goal  and wanted to know how various campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals . A written report of Analyses based on outcome  based on goals and outcome based on launch date need to be submitted.
### Purpose
To provide an opportunity an opportunity to build and apply the skills I have learned in Module1 and submit a written report of Analysis based on Louise play Fever fundraising goal campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges
 Per dataset analysis of Louise' play Fever fundraising goal, the theatre outcome based on launch date is most successful during the  month of May and success rates declines between September to March and month of December is the least successful.  The chart also indicates a visibility of failed campaigns during the month of May. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Months of September to March is not ideal to launch a campaign.
Month of May is the best month to launch a campaign and likely to be successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcome based on goals indicates 76% Percentage successful on goal range less than 1000. 
The number of succesful campaign has the highest leads on goal ranges between 1000 to 4999 with a successful rate of 73%, also the number of project campaign is high falling under this range as well. Low to none of percentage successful  falls on goal ranges between 45000 to 49999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Knowing which season and/or month to launch a kickstarter may be key to success. The dataset do not show a standard date format to better understand the data but a timestamp was provided instead. The launch date column has to be extracted using Year function to determine the percentage of success by launced date.
## Results
The dataset sampling can be concluded that based on Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date,  the month of May is the best month to launch a campaign and it is unlikely succesful to launch campaigns on the months of September to March . The outcome based on Goals is successful on goal ranges between 1000 to 4999 and goal ranges ranges from 45000 and over shows to zero to low success rate. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Months of September to March is not ideal to launch a campaign
Month of May is the best month to launch a campaign and likely to be successful

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The dataset also shows success on both theater and play but her goal may or may not lead to a fail or succeed and that reducing the goals may lead to a more successful kickstart.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?    
The dataset is of limited sampling, we probably  need more data with different countries and have the exact currency conversion to dollar of each country to dataset  to make sure is of representative data

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Perhaps determing the timing to include the length of campaign vs backers donation could help if Louise can reach or not reach her goal.
